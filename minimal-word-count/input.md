# Registering feedback and issues on Pleggit
This page explains how you can contribute to Pleggit by providing feedback and by creating issues. 

To contribute to Pleggit, we use ***Github Issues***. Every feedback on the apps and site can be created as an issue on Pleggit's Github. 

## Accessing Github issues
Accessing Pleggit's issues page is easy: go to https://github.com/nicolasances/pleggit/issues. 

You can also access through the tabs: there's one called "Issues".

## Creating a new issue 
Remember: issues are used to track every type of feedback, not just "errors in the app" or problems with the app, but also requests for enhancing the functionalities. 

To create a new issue, from the "Issues" tab, click on "New Issue".

When creating an issue, please fill: 
 * The title
 * A description, as precise as possible of the error
 * Add some screenshots if they can help understanding your feedback: you can do that by just dragging an image in there or by copying and pasting an image in the description box
 * Specify if you're using android or iOS
 * Specify which version of iOS or Android you're using: 
    * for Android you can find it under "Settings > About phone > Android Version". This could be different based on the phone manufacturer. We only need to know the first number (e.g. 10) not the whole sequence of characters. 
    * for iOS you can find it under "Settings > General > About > Software Version" (e.g. 15.1.1)
 * Specify the phone model
    * for Android you can find it under "Settings > About phone > Device name". This could be different based on the phone manufacturer
    * for iOS you can find it under "Settings > General > About > Model Name" (e.g. iPhone 12)
